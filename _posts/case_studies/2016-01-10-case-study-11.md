excerpt: Margaret came to us suffering from sore teeth, a poor denture that she could
  not wear, and was unhappy with the appearance of her teeth despite having attending
  her previous dentist every 6 months.

By removing some upper teeth that were beyond saving and repairing the lower teeth we were then able to replace her missing teeth by construct an upper denture that gave Margaret a comfortable bite and beautiful new smile. When we were doing this we were able to copy the way that Margaret’s teeth had been in the past as she very kindly provided us with a wedding photo.  
Margaret is delighted with the result and wishes that she had done it years ago
