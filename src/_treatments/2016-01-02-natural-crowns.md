title: Natural Crowns
layout: post_treatment
excerpt: Crowns are often used to protect damaged teeth, it is now possible to construct
  crowns that blend in perfectly with your natural teeth. The picture shows a lady
  who previously had a crown that was obvious when she smiled. Using cutting edge
  techniques and working with a top ceramist we were able to construct a new crown
  that was a perfect match to her natural teeth.
