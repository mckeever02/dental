excerpt: Tooth whitening is a fantastic way to improve the appearance of your natural
  teeth. Professional tooth whitening is a very safe and proven procedure. Whitening
  is carried out using clear custom trays fitted to the teeth (like a small gum shield)
  which are worn at home. This means you hold on to the trays and can "top up" in
  the future as you see fit.
