This was my brother Seamus Gillan, he got hit at football training and came in to me with a broken front tooth. Normally in these situations we would try and reattach the broken fragment, however in his case it was never found so we had to build the tooth back up again using white filling materials. While this will not last as long as a crown it is much kinder for the remaining tooth and still leaves the option open to place a crown/veneer down the line.
