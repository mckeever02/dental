She is a hugely experienced dentist, originally from Colombia, she moved to the Northwest after meeting an Irish man!  Colombia’s loss is our gain.

Diana is an outstanding dentist and prides herself on attention to detail.  She provides a gentle approach and spends a lot of time on her patients’ treatments  to achieve the best aesthetic and functional result.

Diana completed a Restorative Masters with Distinction in Manchester University. Since then, in order to keep her knowledge abreast, she has undertaken several training courses in aesthetics, occlusion and more recently orthodontics.

 Diana is a fanatical Irish rugby fan and attends as many matches as she can. She also enjoys dancing salsa and all the Latin-American rhythms.
