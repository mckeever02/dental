    <p>In our practice we take complaints very seriously indeed and try to ensure that all our patients are happy with their experience of our service. If a patient complains, they are dealt with courteously and promptly so that the matter is resolved as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>Our aim is to react to complaints in the way in which we would want our complaint about a service to be handled. We aim to learn from any mistakes that we make.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The person responsible for dealing with any complaint about the service that we provide is Mr Ciaran Gillan.</li>
      <li>If a patient complains on the telephone or at the reception desk, we will listen to their complaint and offer to refer them to Mr Ciaran Gillan immediately. If Mr Gillan is not available at the time a member of staff will take brief details of the complaint and pass them on.</li>
      <li>If a patient complains in writing the letter will be passed on immediately to Mr Gillan.</li>
      <li>If a complaint is about any aspect of clinical care, this will normally be referred to the dentist, unless the patient does not wish this to happen.</li>
      <li>We will acknowledge the patient's complaint in writing and enclose a copy of this code of practice as soon as possible, normally within three working days. We will seek to investigate the complaint within ten working days of receipt to give an explanation of the circumstances that led to the complaint. If the patient does not wish to meet us, then we will attempt to talk to them on the telephone. If we are unable to investigate the complaint within ten working days we will notify the patient, giving reasons for the delay and a likely period within which the investigation will be completed</li>
      <li>We will seek to investigate the complaint speedily and efficiently and we will keep the patient regularly informed, as far as reasonably practicable, as to the progress of the investigation. Investigation will normally be completed in 10 working days.</li>
      <li>When we have completed our investigation, we will provide the patient with a full written report. The report will include and explanation of how the compliant has been considered. The conclusions reached in respect of each specific part of the complaint, detail of any necessary remedial action and whether the practice is satisfied with any action it has already taken or will be taking as result of the complaint.</li>
      <li>Proper and comprehensive records are kept of any complaint received.</li>
    </ol>
