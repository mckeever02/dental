    <p>To help spread the cost of your dental treatment we provide a range of treatment options including a dental membership plan that entitles you to a 10% discount on treatments up to Â£1500 as well as covering the majority of your routine needs for a reasonable monthly sum.</p>
    <p>For larger treatment plans it is possible to pay over a longer term by setting up a direct debit. </p>
