    <p>Here at dental solutions, we pride ourselves on the level of service and expertise we offer our clients. A lot of effort goes into ensuring that you get the care, detail and precision we would want for ourselves. We are careful, diligent and will not be rushed. Everything we do is evidence based and as a result, we only provide treatment that is known to be effective, safe, reliable and long lasting.</p>

    <p>Despite this, very occasionally treatments do not last as long as they should. So, for peace of mind, we guarantee our work. If a problem should occur, a like-for-like replacement will be provided free of charge.</p>

    <p class="intro-text">We hope our guarantee gives you peace of mind and encourages you to protect your investment in your health and appearance.</p>
